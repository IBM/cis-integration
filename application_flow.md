# Application Flow
![Application Flow and User Interaction](./images/application_flow.png)

Above is a diagram which outlines how a user will interact with out application and outlines how our project will interact with itself. The user will utilize our applications functionality through the command line using `cis-integration`. Along with the `cis-integration` command a user will enter the needed information to connect their CIS instance to their application platform such as their CIS CRN, Zone ID, etc. With this information present the plug point for our application (main.py) will then call the needed functionality (glb creation, dns, certificate creation, and edge function creation) from their respective files. The functionalities listed above utilize the [CIS Python SDK](https://github.com/IBM/networking-python-sdk) called `ibm-cloud-networking-services`. The diagram and information mentioned above is subject to change as the project grows and matures.
